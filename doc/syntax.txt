Logical Operators:
  Logical operators evaluate relationships between a group of
  relational or logical expressions 
    &&,
    &,
    ||,
    |,
    !

  Examples:
    x == 3 && y < 10
    x == 3 && y < 10 && z + 15 <= 25

    !(x == 5)

  Wrong Examples:
    5 && 5
    5 || 2 == 3
    3 < y || y + 3 
    !pi

Relational Operators:
  Relational operators dictate relationships between a
  group of arithmetic expressions.
    =
    ==
    !=
    >
    <
    >=
    <=

  Ex:
    5 == 5
    3 < x < 4 < y (operator chaining is allowed on inequalities)
    x != 2y + 3
    sin(pi/2) = 1.0

  Wrong Examples:
    5 = (y = 3 && x = 4)
    4 < y < 

Arithmetic Operators:
  Arithmetic operators dictate operations between numerical values
  +
  -
  *
  /
  ^
  + (unary)
  - (binary)
